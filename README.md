# CSharp-Learning-Portfolio
# C# Learning Portfolio 💻

This repository contains C# code snippets and exercises developed during my learning process, specifically focusing on **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)** principles.

### 🚀 What I'm Practicing
* **Classes & Objects:** Defining blueprints for real-world entities.
* **Methods:** Creating reusable code blocks.
* **Control Structures:** Loops, If-Else logic, and Switch cases.
* **Basic Algorithms:** Solving logical problems using C#.

### 📂 About the Code
Currently, this repo hosts standalone `.cs` files demonstrating basic syntax and structure. More complex projects with SQL database integration will be added as I progress in the "BTK Academy" curriculum.
